# Joke Generator using React JS and Joke API

*__purpose__: practice useState() hook and learn how to use API since I've no experience in it.*

*__idea__:one-page web app that generates Dad jokes once you click on a button.*

*__important things learnt__:*  

* useState() hook
* Promises
* Fetching data

*__comments:__ it was my first time launching React at my desktop VS code( I used Coursera's lab version previously), so I stumbled upon some issues such as script React Create App being obsolete since it is not compatible with React 19. therefore, I suppose I will use Vite when starting my next projects.*
