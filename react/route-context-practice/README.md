# Simple website with navigation

*__purpose__: practice useState() and useContext hook, Browser Router. *

*__idea__:a web app that has simple navigation. home page provides an input field where you should enter some text. any time you enter text it would be visible also at "personal page" page of web app*

*__important things learnt__:*  

* useState() hook
* useContext() hook
* React Router

*__comments:__ i've launched React with Vite for the first time. this tiny project has no intent of  containing any logic, I just wanted to practice mixing useState, useContext hooks and React Router.I wanted to see how metioned hooks would work with routing system.*
